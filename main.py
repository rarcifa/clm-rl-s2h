run_all.py â€” Script to Train and Evaluate RL and Heuristic CLM Strategies

This is the main entry point to execute the full pipeline:
    1. Trains PPO and DQN agents using `train.py`
    2. Evaluates trained agents and heuristics using `evaluate.py`

Assumes both scripts are in the same directory and properly configured.
